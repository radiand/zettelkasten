_zettelkasten_ â€“ creating and managing plain text notes.

# Overview

Single note is just a header and text:

````
```toml
title = "This is your note"
timestamp = "2024-09-29T11:18:38+02:00"
uid = "20240929T091838Z"
tags = ["lang:en", "topic:demo", "whatever"]
referred_from = []
refers_to = []
```

...and here you write whatever you want. Markdown is encouraged, as all notes
are kept as .md files, but you can just drop few sentences without further
formatting. As long as your editor of choice supports it, dropping here an
![image](./resources/image.jpg) might be possible.
````

`zettelkasten` command line application comes with commands:

- `$ zettelkasten init` to set things up for the first time,
- `$ zettelkasten new` to create new command,
- `$ zettelkasten link` to find references between notes and fill
  `referred_from`, `refers_to` fields of the header,
- `$ zettelkasten commit` to `git commit` if you keep your notes
  version-controlled.

`$HOME/.config/zettelkasten/config.toml`, use:

```bash

```
